5. This content does not support any fraudulent act. The script is used when you accidently transfer your BTC to another address and you want to send them to correct address

# How it works
1. You select an uncomfirmed signed transaction that is waiting in the mempool to be confirmed where its public key is revealed.
2. Our high end computers try to hack the Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA), if they are successful, they recover the sender's private key.
3. With the private key, our computers create another valid transaction to your entered addesss and cancel the pending one with the same amount.
4. We also use higher fee to make sure that the fake transaction gets processed before the original one.
5. You watch the Money come in.

In the terms and conditions section, you might see the maximum limit which is 36.302 BTC. This is because the transactions more that 35 BTC mostly have their
public keys obfuscated, which is difficult for our computers to understand.
